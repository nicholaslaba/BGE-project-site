					<h2>BGE Methodology</h2>
					
					<p> 
					Best Group Ever (BGE) works closely with you, our client, and subject-matter experts to 
					work out a plan tailored to your needs. We understand one size does not fit all, so we 
					make sure to ask the right questions to get you thinking, and continue to expand our 
					discovery to make sure we capture the finer details.</p>
					
					<p>Various team members will work on your project from discovery straight through until 
					completion. They will work together as your dedicated project team&#8212;each responsible 
					for specific deliverables.</p>
					
					<h2>Project Phases</h2>
					
					<h3>Definition</h3>
					
					<p>Projects are launched with a discovery or project Definition phase, which is meant to be 
					valuable and informative for all involved. This is where we: </p>
					
					<ul>
					
						<li>define the project goals</li>
						<li>understand the audience</li>
						<li>gather requirements</li>
						<li>define scope (& budget)</li>
						<li>determine key stakeholders</li>
					
					</ul>
					
					<p>You will complete a Questionnaire that will help us answer the following:</p>
					
					<ul>
					
						<li>What is your business and your brand?</li>
						<li>Who are your customers?</li>
						<li>What is your usage environment?</li>
						<li>What is your strategy?</li>
						<li>What do you know about your customer?</li>
						<li>What do you know about your customer segments? </li>
						<li>How can you deliver value to your customers?</li>
						<li>How will content lead you? </li>
						<li>How do you plan to manage content changes?</li>
						<li>What is the competition doing?</li>
					
					</ul>
					
					<p>Following discovery, the BGE Project Management team will produce a high-level 
					summary of the information we gathered during this phase&#8212;a Creative Brief. This will 
					include a summary of your objectives and our deliverables, for review and approval.</p>
					
					<p>The project management team will also be working to:</p>
					
					<ul>
					
						<li>determine resources</li>
						<li>create a schedule of implementation deliverables: who is doing what by when</li>
						<li>implement communication reporting</li>
					
					</ul>
					
					<p>BGE works closely with our clients to determine a plan that works for them.</p>
					
					<h3>Site Development</h3>
					
					<p>During this phase our BGE UI/UX team will produce:</p>
					
					<ul>
					
						<li>a list of target users and user profiles</li>
						<li>user scenarios that walk through a userâ€™s experience from beginning to end</li>
						<li>an outline of the content that will be included in the project, including the tone</li>
						<li>information architecture, including a sitemap of proposed site</li>
						<li>wireframes of key pages, describing the user interface</li>
					
					</ul>
					
					<h3>Design</h3>
					
					<p>Our BGE team will launch the creative process by:</p>
					
					<ul>
					
						<li>reviewing goals, user scenarios, and content</li>
						<li>creating visual elements such as colour schemes, layouts and styles</li>
						<li>providing A/B design options, where applicable</li>
						<li>drafting requirements, which act as a set of instructions for the development team</li>
					
					</ul>
					
					<p>BGE will also create a working proto-site for you to walk-through. Your feedback will be 
					used to create the final templates for the site, including a detailed Style Guide and 
					Standards (SGS) document.</p>
					
					<h3>Production & Testing</h3>
					
					<p>SGS in hand, we will:</p>
					
					<ul>
					
						<li>review technical restraints and select appropriate technologies</li>
						<li>set the file structure for the final site</li>
						<li>code page based on the approved templates</li>
						<li>assign a dedicated Quality Assurance team to create a test plan, run test scenarios and set-up issue logs</li>
										
					</ul>
					
					<p>BGE utilizes a form of agile methodology to move through our planning, analysis, design, 
					development and testing phases, before deployment</p>
